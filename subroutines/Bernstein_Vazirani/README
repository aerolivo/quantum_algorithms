This directory contains a basic quantum algorithm simulator.

It is inspired by JSQubits (https://github.com/davidbkemp/jsqubits), but is usually much faster.
It is realatively fast for reasonable number of qubits, thanks to Luajit implementation (5x faster than JSQubits on Firefox/Chrome).

Example algorithms include:
1. Bernstein-Vazirani
2. Superdense-coding
3. Shor's algorithm

Unlike IBM's Qiskit, this simulator is *not* a gate-level simulator. It rather works at a higher abstraction level (similar to JSQubits).
