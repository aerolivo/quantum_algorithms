# Linear System Solve Algorithm

## Solves Ax = b
Contains implementation of the Harrow, Hassidim and Llyod algorithm for a 2x2 system. A = [1.5 0.5;0.5 1.5]
1. linear_system.ipynb is a ipython notebook with the code and comparing theoretical and simulated expectation values of |x> with respect to X, Y, Z
2. three cases of b are considered -- |0>, |+>, |->
